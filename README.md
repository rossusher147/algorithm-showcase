# ðŸ§  Algorithm Showcase

A curated repository of algorithm implementations designed to demonstrate clean code, testing, and software engineering discipline.  
Includes time/space complexity, detailed comments, and CI-driven unit testing.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Clean, well-documented algorithm implementations  
- ðŸ§© Time and space complexity for each algorithm  
- ðŸ§ª Continuous Integration (CI) with automated unit tests  
- ðŸ’¬ Clear inline documentation and explanations     

---

## ðŸ§ª Unit Testing & Continuous Integration

This repository uses unit tests (via pytest) to verify the correctness of both implementations.
 
### ðŸ§± CI Integration

The Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline runs automatically on every push and pull request using GitHub Actions.
It performs the following steps:

- ðŸ§© Set up Python and install dependencies
- ðŸ§ª Run all unit tests
- ðŸ§¹ Check code formatting and linting
- âœ… Report test status directly on GitHub pull requests
